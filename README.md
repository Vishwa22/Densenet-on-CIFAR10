# Densenet-on-CIFAR10

This is one of tutorial from my early deep learning days. It is beginner friendly `keras` tutorial to get you feet wet with basics of deep learning.

It includes concepts of:

- Image augmentation
- Transfer learning
- Learning rate scheduling

Deep learning model used here is `DenseNet`

The goal is to get best accuracy on validation data (test data) of close to 90% within 50 epochs! Check out the IPython Notebook [Densenet_on_CIFAR10.ipynb](https://github.com/Vishwa22/Densenet-on-CIFAR10/blob/master/Densenet_on_CIFAR10.ipynb)
